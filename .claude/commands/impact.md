- If is not mentioned where to get the changes from use the currently staged changes
- If a PR is provided use gh to get the changes

- Identify which routes will be potentially affected by the changes

## Report

- Generate a detailed report using the playground skill inside the impact/ folder
- Include mermaidjs mmd diagrams in the playground document
  - Add a sequence diagram for each of the potentially affected routes highlighting the areas were the changes are
